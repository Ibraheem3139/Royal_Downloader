Free YouTube Video Playlist Downloader

# Attention Please
I hope you are all doing well.

As we all know that, YouTube is the best video application, and everyone from you always wants to download videos from the youtube, as there are are many websites and softwares which allows us to download a single video from the youtube but when we talked about the youtube playlist there is no such proper software which help us to download entire playlist on a single click, as there are many web based and desktop applications like IDM, but most of them are paid and after cracking those softwares sometimes we may face some issues, so, to overcome this issue i have developed a simple software named as "Royal Downloader" which will help you to download the entire playlist from any youtube channel on a single click.

# Note:
I am not encouraging piracy, as the content creator on Youtube is doing a great job and working hard, and there is no purpose to D-Grade their work. The main purpose of this application is to help those students who want to learn from YouTube but, due to network issues or electricity issues, are not able to watch the videos properly. This application helps those students download those lectures when they get proper network access and learn properly through downloaded videos.

One more thing is that when you people complete your courses and start earning, just pay tribute to those channels from where you downloaded their lectures. For that, just watch their videos and pay tribute, as they are our mentors.

# Prerequistes
This application is almost 10 MB in size and will run on any PC or laptop.

For storage, you may have up to 10GB of space on your PC to download the videos.

# About this application:
It is a simple Python-based application, and you don't need to install Python or any other extension on your PC.

This application will never harm your PC, as it is completely secure and a simple programme. It may show some issues while directly downloading via GitHub, but it is just because of the "exe" file.

If you face any issues while downloading or installing this application, it is just because of system differences. The other PC may have different system configurations, security settings, or software versions. It's possible that your PC has additional security measures, but overall, you will never face any issues.

I have added the application file to my GitHub account, which people can download from there.

If you don't have a GitHub account, then download this application from the given.rar file and extract it on your PC or laptop.

# How to use
You just need to download the file, run it as an administrator, copy the YouTube playlist URL that you want to download, and then press the "Enter Key." It automatically starts downloading videos. Note: Videos will be downloaded automatically by creating a new folder and will be downloaded in sequence.

Make sure you have an active internet connection while downloading these videos.

This application has been tested on different laptops and PCs, and it is working properly.

If you face this error "W//W+" or any related error, it is just because of a slow internet connection, so make sure you have an active internet connection.

# Note that the videos that are private and not available on the Youtube Playlist won't be downloaded because of the Youtube policy, but I'll try to bypass this in the next release.
